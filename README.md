DitchAMetting
=============

Web application that provides a scheduled phone callback to give you a reason to excuse yourself from a meeting.


Building
=============

DitchAMeeting is built on the Meteor technology stack. The project uses some of the newer features of the platform 
which require us to use the ```mrt``` tool instead of the original ```meteor``` tool. See docs here:

  http://oortcloud.github.com/meteorite/
  
Once installed, change into dir ```DitchAMeeting``` and run command: ```mtr run``` to start a local instance of the service.
